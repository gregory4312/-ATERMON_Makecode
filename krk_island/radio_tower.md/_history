Use your agent to collect the resources on the map. Use multiple ``||agent: agent move forward||`` as well as ``||agent: agent turn||`` blocks and place them in the ``||Loops:on start||`` block. When you're finished, click **RUN**. Careful, do it in a single run or else it won't work.\n\n### ~ Hint \nYou can change the number of steps your Agent will move by changing the number inside the ``||agent: agent move||`` block. You also can use an ``||agent: agent turn||`` block to turn the Agent to the left or right.\n\n```  blocks\n         agent.move(FORWARD, 2)\n         agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)\n          agent.move(FORWARD, 1)\n         agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)\n          agent.move(FORWARD, 3)\n         agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)\n          agent.move(FORWARD, 5)\n         agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)\n          agent.move(FORWARD, 3)\n         agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)\n          agent.move(FORWARD, 2)\n         agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)\n          agent.move(FORWARD, 1)\n         agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)\n         \n})\n```\n\n\n","main.blocks":"","main.ts":"","README.md":"","pxt.json":"{\n    \"name\": \"-atermon_makecode-krk_island-radio_towermd\",\n    \"dependencies\": {\n        \"core\": \"*\",\n        \"builder\": \"*\",\n        \"-atermon_makecode\": \"github:gregory4312/-atermon_makecode\"\n    },\n    \"files\": [\n        \"\",\n        \"main.blocks\",\n        \"main.ts\",\n        \"README.md\"\n    ],\n    \"preferredEditor\": \"blocksprj\"\n}\n"}}],"shares":[]}
